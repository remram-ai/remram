Product Definition

---

## 1\. Overview

One tight paragraph that clearly explains:

*   What this feature is
*   Who it is for
*   Why it matters

This should read like a refined elevator pitch without hype.  
No implementation detail. No architecture.

---

## 2\. Problem Statement

What is broken or insufficient today?

*   Current system failures
*   Structural misalignment or incentives
*   User pain points
*   Why existing solutions do not solve the problem

Be specific. This section anchors the necessity of the feature.

---

## 3\. Value Proposition

What changes because this feature exists?

*   Direct user benefit
*   System-level advantage
*   Strategic leverage within the platform
*   Clear differentiation from alternatives

This section should be explicit and defensible.

---

## 4\. User Experience Model

How the user interacts with the feature.

*   Entry point
*   Interaction patterns
*   Feedback mechanisms
*   Customization options
*   Output formats

Describe experience, not internal mechanics.

---

## 5\. Feature Scope

What this feature does:

*   Core capabilities
*   Behavioral responsibilities
*   Output surfaces

What this feature explicitly does not do.

Keep boundaries clear to prevent scope creep.

*   Trust graph

Describe interface-level dependency only.  
Do not restate architectural documentation.

### Data & Memory Interactions

Reads:

*   Which indices
*   Which profiles
*   Which rank features

Writes:

*   What artifacts are created
*   What signals are updated
*   What preference or rank adjustments occur

---

## 7\. Governance & Risk

Potential risks introduced by this feature:

*   Bias or personalization drift
*   Escalation overuse
*   Misinformation amplification
